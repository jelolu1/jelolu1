👋🏻 Hi! I’m Jesús Lorenzo, a software and electronic engineer currently based in Leipzig, Germany!

I’m interested in Web Development, mainly in focusing in Front End side, but really interested as well in Back End technologies, Databases and Algorithms. I am also interested in everything related to technology but mainly in Informatics, Electronics, Embedded Systems and 3D Printing.

I’m currently learning Next JS, which is becoming one of my favourites technologies!

I’m looking for new profesional opportunities working as Front End Developer and to collaborate with a team in my next job. 

You can reach me here in GitHub or via my LinkedIn Profile: www.linkedin.com/in/jesús-lorenzo-lucas-a1531b17b.
